        <p>Hello, my name is Steven A. Nieves Ferrer. I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at the Inter
            American University
            of Puerto Rico and I am very passionate about my career. Some of my freetime hobbies consist of playing
            videogames, watching
            movies or coding. I also like to study history and I'm interested in learing about Artificial Intelligence
            in the near future. </p>

        <p>I have always been interested in tech and it has influenced my decision to study my career. One of the first
            steps I took was enrolling in a articulation program from the University of Puerto Rico to help get me
            familiarized with my degree.
            Overall, I find STEM related fields interesting and look foward to learn new skills.</p>

                        project consist of app that lets the user see different tabs of characters from the Xenoblade
                        Chronicles video game. The user can also hear audio clips for each of the characters. The top
                        right portion of the project contains a menu that allows the user to view the games trailer,
                        website and fill out a small form of their favorite character.</p>
