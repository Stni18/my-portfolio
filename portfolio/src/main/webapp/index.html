        <p>Hello, my name is Steven A. Nieves Ferrer. I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at the Inter
            American University
            of Puerto Rico and I am very passionate about my career. Some of my freetime hobbies consist of playing
            videogames, watching
            movies or coding. I also like to study history and I'm interested in learing about Artificial Intelligence
            in the near future. </p>

        <p>I have always been interested in tech and it has influenced my decision to study my career. One of the first
            steps I took was enrolling in a articulation program from the University of Puerto Rico to help get me
            familiarized with my degree.
            Overall, I find STEM related fields interesting and look foward to learn new skills.</p>
